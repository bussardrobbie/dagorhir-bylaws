The result may be a Game-Wide Suspension, a Game-Wide Ban, or the conclusion that no Game-Wide disciplinary action needs to be taken. The Arbiter is responsible for the Communication of this decision, for maintaining a Record of it, and providing updates to Chapters regarding the Arbiter’s List. This is all detailed in subsequent sections.
 
4.7.  Performance and Duties
 
4.7.1. Written Complaints – The Arbiter must fairly and impartially investigate complaints brought to their attention in writing.
 
4.7.1.1. Absent specific hardship, communication should be made to arbiter@dagorhir.com If the complainant does not have the ability to transmit the complaint and/or documentation in electronic format, materials can be mailed to the address maintained by the executive director or trusted proxy.

4.7.1.3. Documentation provided to the Arbiter in relation to a Complaint should be as comprehensive and detailed as possible. When available, links to external sources of information should be provided (e.g. court records, media articles, etc.).

4.7.2. Investigation – The Arbiter should make reasonable efforts to promptly and fully Investigate the matter, to include contacting and interviewing all involved parties, verifying sources, and otherwise obtaining full details. However:
 
4.7.2.1. Unavailability of the person about whom a complaint was filed is not a bar to disciplinary action being taken.
 
4.7.2.2. In situations where the Arbiter has verified that the individual has existing criminal convictions for offenses that the Arbiter believes speak to that individual being a danger to the membership, disciplinary action can be taken without conducting interviews.

4.7.3.4.3. A conclusion that no action needs to be taken.

That is, the Arbiter must not conclude—absent criminal conviction—that any particular offense definitively occurred. Rather, the Arbiter is engaging in risk management on behalf of Dagorhir, and will make decisions with an eye to player safety.
 
4.7.3.6. The color code (RYG) for each category in the DBGA-provided Ban/Suspension rubric.
 
4.7.4. Communication – The Arbiter has a duty to communicate any Written Decision as follows:
 
4.7.4.1. To the Local Leadership of the affected Chapter(s)
 
4.7.4.2. To the DBGA BOD

4.7.4.4. To the person named in the Complaint:
 
4.7.4.4.1. A general, privacy-respecting context for the decision (e.g. “Due to multiple complaints around causing physical altercations at events…”).

4.7.5. Appointed Alternate – In situations where there may be a conflict of interest, the Arbiter must appoint an Investigator. To be perfectly clear, Arbiters may not investigate any complaint where they are familiar with any involved parties or where they are involved in the matter under discussion. Those are not, however, the only situations in which an Arbiter may need to be absent. The following apply:
 
4.7.5.1. The Alternate may also not have any conflicts of interest in the matter being considered.
 
4.7.5.2. The Appointment of an Alternate lasts for only the duration of the current Investigation.
 
4.7.5.3. The Alternate is not a BoD member.
 
4.7.5.4. The Alternate takes over responsibility for the Investigation, Written Decision, and Communication as detailed above.
 
4.7.5.5. The name of the Alternate, the Arbiter’s reason for recusing themselves, and the rationale for appointing that Alternate shall also be included in the Written Decision (above).
