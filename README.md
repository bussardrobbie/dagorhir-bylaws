# dagorhir-bylaws
A version-controlled copy of the Dagorhir Battle Games Association bylaws. The purpose of this specific repository is to track changes across the bylaws and to publicize proposed rule changes and make it easier to compare bylaw versions against one another during proposals or post-submission analysis by the Chapter Council / interested parties.
